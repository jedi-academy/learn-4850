    <slide title="Lab Goals" layout="normal">
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to
            CodeIgniter and the workflow for working with
            webapps.</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Submission" layout="normal">
        <p>Your lab will be completed in a github repository.</p>
        <p>Submit a readme to the lab dropbox, with a link to your github repository.</p>
        <p>Due: three days after your lab, eg. Thursday lab period will have theirs
            due Sunday, Jan 17, 17:30 PST</p>
            <hr/>
        <p>This is a pair lab, sharing s single repository, but each using
        their own github account and computer.</p>
        <p>If you insist on working on your own, you will need to setup a second github
        account, and use two machines, to get the full benefit of the lab.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Preparation" layout="normal">
        <p>Two devops tutorials are provided to help setup your development
        environment for CodeIgniter. These should be done on each
        of the machines you will be using.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://devops.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/setup02" target="_blank">setup02</a>: virtual hosting</li>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://devops.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/setup04" target="_blank">setup04</a>: CodeIgniter starter</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Work" layout="normal">
        <p>There are three tutorials to complete for this lab, for marks...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://codeigniter.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/basic01" target="_blank">basic01</a>: trivial CI site </li>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://codeigniter.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/basic02" target="_blank">basic02</a>: basic CodeIgniter webapp</li>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://codeigniter.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/basic03" target="_blank">basic02</a>: good CodeIgniter webapp</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Process" layout="normal">
        <p>Here comes the fun part...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of you will fork the starter repo, and add the other team member as a collaborator.</li>
            <li>Each of you will clone your shared repo to their respective machines.</li>
            <li>Complete the first tutorial with one of you "driving" and the other "navigatins". When done,
            make sure you commit and push your changes to your shared repo.</li>
            <li>Before starting the second tutorial, switch roles and computers. The new driver will need
            to synchronize their repo with the shared one, and then work through the tutorial.
            Remember to commit and push when done.</li>
            <li>Before completing the third tutorial, switch roles and machines again. Synchronize,
            complete tht tutorial, and push/commit your changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>This lab will be marked out of 10, as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tutorial basic01: trivial CI site (3)</li>
            <li>Tutorial basic02: basic CodeIgniter webapp (3)</li>
            <li>Tutorial basic02: good CodeIgniter webapp (2)</li>
            <li>Process - proper commit history (2)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your github repository will be in a state consistent with the end of one of the above,
        and you do not need three repos!</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Disclaimer" layout="normal">
        <p>We will not necessarily be following "best practices" throughout this lab.</p>
        <p>Our focus is on "baby steps", that will lead to best practices over the
            next few labs.</p>
    </slide>
