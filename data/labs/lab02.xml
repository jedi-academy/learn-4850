    <slide title="Lab Goals" layout="normal">
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to
            CodeIgniter and the workflow for working with
            webapps.</p>
        <p>This lab is *not* indicative of the process you want to use when in
            "full development" mode ... it has you share a single repository, with
            both members of a team having write access - a recipe for disaster!  
            I set the lab up this way
            to break you in gently to good collaboration practices - if you mess
            things up now, it is relatively easy to recover :)</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Submission" layout="normal">
        <p>Your lab will be completed in a github repository.</p>
        <p>Submit a readme to the lab dropbox, with a link to your github repository.</p>
        <p>Due: three days after your lab, eg. Thursday lab period will have theirs
            due Sunday, Jan 17, 17:30 PST</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>This is a pair lab, sharing a single repository, but each using
            their own github account and computer.</p>
        <p>If you insist on working on your own, you will need to setup a second github
            account, and use two machines, to get the full benefit (and marks) of the lab.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Preparation" layout="normal">
        <p>There are a few things to sort out before fiving into the CodeIgniter 
            lab itself - "process":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your D2L group</li>
                <li>get github setup</li>
                <li>clone your repo</li>
                <li>configure your AMP setup</li>
                <li>make a CodeIgniter starter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I originally referenced some devops tutorials for these, but that proved
            confusing. I will walk you through it, instead.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - D2L Group" layout="normal">
        <p>This lab is for group submission, and I have set up groups for each
        set, with up to two members, self-enrolled.</p>
        <p>Choose a partner for this lab. One of you should enrol in a group,
        to claim it, and the other should join that group.</p>
        <p>If you inadvertently end up paired with the wrong teammate,
        let me know during lab and I can fix that.</p>
        <p>The groups are for this lab only, and do not have to be maintained for 
            the assignments. You will be setting up assignment teams next week.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - Github" layout="normal">
        <p>If you are a team of one, you will need to create a second github account
        for yourself, and plan to use a different machine for each acocunt. 
        We want to replicate a collaborative environment, with two developers
        sharing a common repository.</p>
        <p>One of you should fork the starter repository for the lab, and they
        should then add their teammate as a collaborator, with write permission.
        You should both be able to push code to the repo!</p>
        <p>You are welcome to change the repo name, in its Github settings, if
        that makes more sense to you. It will still show as a fork of the starter.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - Cloning" layout="normal">
        <p>Each of you will want to clone the shared repository to your development system,
        be it your laptop or one of the lab machines.</p>
        <p>Clone it into the *htdocs* (or equivalent) folder within your AMP stack.</p>
        <p>The foldername can be anything meaningful to you, for instance "comp4711lab02",
        or you can stick with "example-gallery" all the way through.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - Post-Cloning" layout="normal">
        <p>After cloning, you should be able to see the starter's image gallery
            using the URL "localhost/comp4711lab02/public". This is only
        to make sure it is in the proper place, and not what you will use for
        development.</p>
        <p>You do NOT want to have to use a URL like "localhost/comp4711/labs/lab02/public" -
        that is too many folders deep!!</p>
        <p>I trust you remembered to inject the port number you assigned
        during AMP setup, if other than 80 ... for instance,
        "localhost:4711/comp4711lab02/public"</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - Local Domain" layout="normal">
        <p>We want to use domain based hosting, so that media references
            work properly in spite of apparent folder names in an URL.
        The apparent foloder names can confuse your browser if you use sub-sontroller methods.</p>
        <p>For instance, "/product/buy/shoes/1" looks to the browser like it is inside the
        website folder "product/buy/shoes", but there is no such folder. Relative image
        references, such as "../assets/images/blah" will not work properly.</p>
        <p>Add one or more local domain names to your <code>hosts</code> file.
        This could be names that you remap each week as needed, for instance "comp4711.local",
        or you could add a new domain each week, eg. "4711lab02.local", "4711lab03.local", etc.</p>
        <p>Do this by adding a line to the end of your <code>hosts</code> file, like<br/>
        <code>127.0.0.1 comp4711.local project.local 4711lab25.local</code>
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - Virtual Hosting" layout="normal">
        <p>Configure your Apache virtual hosting, found in <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code>
        inside the <code>extra</code> folder of your Apache configuration folder.</p>
        <p>Your AMP comes with a couple of VirtualHost definitions, that are to be
        used as examples only - they are not real, and can be deleted or commented out once done.</p>
        <p>You want to end up with several VirtualHosts - one for the *default*, and
        one for each local domain.</p>
        <p>Each VirtualHost definition needs a ServerName, eg <code>comp4711.local</code>,
        and then the DocumentRoot that domain should be mapped to (with no trailing slash), for instance
        <code>/opt/lampstack-5.5.30-1/apache2/htdocs/comp4711lab02</code>.</p>
        <p>The first VirtualHost defined in the config file is special - it is
        the AMP base installation, eg. the Bitnami start page.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - CodeIgniter Setup" layout="normal">
        <p>Download CodeIgniter, the current release from 
        https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/archive/3.0.4.zip</p>
        <p>Extract this inside your downloads folder - you should end up with a 
            <code>CodeIgniter-3.0.4</code> folder, containing <code>application</code>,
            <code>system</code> and <code>user_guide</code> folders, as well as
            an <code>index.php</code> and some other files.
        </p>
        <p>Move the <code>system</code> folder inside your <code>htdocs</code>,
        and rename it to <code>system3</code>.</p>
        <p>If you want to keep the user guide handy for local reference, move the
        <code>user_guide</code> folder somewhere you can easily find it, for 
        instance your desktop, and possibly renamed suitably. If you prefer to
        read the user guide online, then just delete the <code>user_guide</code> folder.</p>
        <p>The stuff remaining in your <code>CodeIgniter-3.0.4</code> folder will
        be your "CodeIgniter starter" folder, for new projects. You might want
        to rename it appropriately.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Prep - Prepared" layout="normal">
        <p>Now you are ready to begin the lab proper.</p>
        <p>You should have your <code>htdocs</code> folder ready to roll,
        with the CodeIgniter <code>system3</code> framework folder inside it,
        as well as your lab's project folder.
        </p>
        <p>You will have a local domain defined and virtual hosting setup in
        your Apache.</p>
        <p>You may have the CodeIgniter user guide in a folder on your desktop 
            for convenience.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Work" layout="normal">
        <p>There are three tutorials to complete for this lab, for marks...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://codeigniter.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/basic01" target="_blank">basic01</a>: trivial CI site </li>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://codeigniter.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/basic02" target="_blank">basic02</a>: basic CodeIgniter webapp</li>
            <li>Tutorial <a href="http://codeigniter.jlparry.com/show/tutorial/basic03" target="_blank">basic02</a>: good CodeIgniter webapp</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Process" layout="normal">
        <p>Here comes the fun part...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of you will fork the starter repo, and add the other team member as a collaborator.</li>
            <li>Each of you will clone your shared repo to their respective machines.</li>
            <li>Complete the first tutorial with one of you "driving" and the other "navigating". When done,
                make sure you (the driver) commit and push your changes to your shared repo.</li>
            <li>Before starting the second tutorial, switch roles and computers. The new driver will need
                to synchronize their repo with the shared one, and then work through the tutorial.
                Remember to commit and push when done.</li>
            <li>Before completing the third tutorial, switch roles and machines again. Synchronize,
                complete the tutorial, and push/commit your changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>This lab will be marked out of 10, as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tutorial basic01: trivial CI site (3)</li>
            <li>Tutorial basic02: basic CodeIgniter webapp (3)</li>
            <li>Tutorial basic02: good CodeIgniter webapp (2)</li>
            <li>Process - proper commit history (2)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your github repository will be in a state consistent with the end of one of the above,
            and you do not need three repos!</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Disclaimer" layout="normal">
        <p>We will not necessarily be following "best practices" throughout this lab.</p>
        <p>Our focus is on "baby steps", that will lead to best practices over the
            next few labs.</p>
    </slide>
