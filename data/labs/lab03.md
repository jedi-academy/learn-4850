# Lab03 - Enhance Your Sushi Menu
ACIT4850 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Lab Goals

This lab applies the techniques from seminar 03, to add to
your sushi menu XML document (and then present it).

## Lab Submission

This is an individual lab.

A marking rubric is attached to the dropbox.

Submit a compressed copy of your project folder (zip or tarball) to the appropriate D2L dropbox.

Due: Sunday, Jan 27, 17:30 PST

## And ... Here We Go

Enhance your Node app from last week, to process the supplied kids menu
and add it as a new category to your sushi menu XML document.

Save the programatically-modified document as `data/newmenu.xml`
inside your project. Your app will need to replace it if it
is already present when the app is run.

Produce the same kind of HTML page as last week. That part of
your app shouldn't need any changes... unless your document
structure is awkward :-/
