## And ... Here We Go

Enhance your Node app from last week, adding a DTD to constrain your
sushi menu XML document, and binding the XML document to it.
Your app should continue to present the menu as an HTML page,
on request, but it should also validate the document against
the DTD, and display the validation results to the console.

Use the enhanced menu from last week ("newmenu.xml") as
the menu to process. You do not need to add to it further.
