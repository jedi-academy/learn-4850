## And ... Here We Go

Devise a suitable schema for your sushi menu, and bind your menu XML
to it.

Enhance your app to validate using the schema.

If your original XML does not have data suiting own types, attributes, 
enumeration constraints or somewhat complex multiplicity, then modify it to do so. 
If you have more than one example of any of these, and you wish a particular 
one to be considered, then draw my attention to it.

**Ask for advice when (if?) you get stuck!**
