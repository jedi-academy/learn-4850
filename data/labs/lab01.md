# Lab01 - Sushi Menu XML Document
ACIT4850 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Lab Goals

This lab applies the techniques from the seminar 01, to build your own
XML document.

The value to this exercise is the lab feedback about the design
decisions reflected in your XML document.

## Lab Teams?

This is an individual lab, though you will be exchanging some source
data with a classmate.

## Lab Submission

Submit your lab 1 to the appropriate D2L dropbox.

Due: Sunday, Jan 13, 17:30 PST

## Lab Marking Guideline

If your XML document is not well-formed, you earn a grade of 0.

If it is well-formed but attribute-centric (like a spreadsheet),
you earn half-marks.

If it is well-formed, you earn full marks.

## And ... Here We Go

I will distribute a menu fragment to each class member,
for one of five sushi restaurants.

Devise an XML document to model three items in the
same category.

I recommend that you ask my opinion once this is completed.

Swap menu pages with a classmate who also has a menu page
from the same restaurant.

Modify your XML document by adding three items in a
different category.

You will likely have to change your intended design
to achieve consistency between menu categories.

At this point, there are no wrong answers (apart from those
mentioned in the guidelines) - just answers that will
be awkward to work with moving forward.

## Thinking ahead...

Each week, you will be adding more data to your document,
and constraining or mangling it to fit that week's topic.

Yes, I am evil.
