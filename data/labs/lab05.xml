        <p>The purpose of this lab is to help you explore and practice
            some of the model techniques
            from the models lesson.</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>
        <p>Due date: I have agreed to delay lab due dates by a couple of
            days, to afford flexibility in managing your time.
            The submission deadline is five days after your scheduled lab.</p>

    <slide title="Lab Completion" layout="normal">
        <p>Your lab will be completed in a github repository.
            This will be your (forked) starter-jimsjoint repo. 
        </p>
        <p>Follow gitflow workflow practices (forking &amp; branching).</p>
        <p>I have created teams for you for this lab. If you end up as a team of one,
            complete this on your own - you do not need to create a phantom user :-/
            Use pair programming, with one of you setting things up and
            then implementing the even numbered fixes, and with the other
            implementing the odd numbered fixes.</p>
        <p>Please make sure that your work is in the "master" branch
            or your repository, when done, and that any other branch(es) have
            been merged into it.</p>
        <p>Submit a readme to the lab dropbox, with a link to your github repository.</p>

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>The tutorial addresses three models, and the corresponding changes to 
            our two controllers.</p>
        <p>The menu and orderitems models are trivial, and effectively done. 
            The orders model is where most of the action happens. 
            The orders model has five methods needed, for 1 mark each.</p>
        <p>Making the welcome and order controllers work properly will get you 
            1 and 2 marks, respectively.</p>
        <p>Proper git workflow makes up the last 2 marks.</p>
