## Week 9 - Mar 4

Two things to share with you this week: XML keys and XML annotations.
The first is a heads up at this point, and something you *could*
integrate into assignment 2. The second is how you should be commenting
the elements and attributes of your schema, and it will be added to the
rubric for assignment 2, when I create the dropbox.

No specific reading for this week - just make sure you have the first cut
of your schemas for me to take a look at. Once we have talked about keys
and annotations, and done a small exercise with them, you will have time
to work on your assignment.

I have made a few corrections to the post spring break sessions, with an
extra week on XSL but dropping XML-FO and XML databases. We will talk
about the XML pipeline during the review session in week 13.

### Lab 5

I have finished grading lab 5, and posted the marks. They were not very good.
I hope that the time we spent alst week, and working on assignment 2 this week,
will help improve your understanding and construction of XSDs!

### Assignment 2

From what I observed with your lab 5, and pursuant to today's session and
assignment 1 review with each team, I am adding some directions to
assignment 2 - not to make more work for you, but to help focus
your design & activity!

## Week 8 - Feb 25

I don't want to start on XSL until you & I are comfortable with your handling
of schemas. 

I want to go over recent labs & assignment 1 with you, and remove barriers to
moving forward.

**Update**: I added a note about DOCTYPEs - see the week 8 tab below.

## Week 6 - Feb 11

Please work through Seminar05 from last week (the one I forgot to push to the
repo). It will be the starting point for this week's deeper dive
into schemas!

This week's seminar & lab are ready for you.

## Week 5 - Feb 4

We start our exploration of XML schemas this week, and I just know you
have been looking forward to this, after DTDs!

We will take a light look at schema basics, including simple and complex
elements, but leave the heavier stuff until next week. This will let
us put time aside in class for you to work on your assignment, and
get help with it.

As preparation for class this week, please read the 
[W3Schools XML Schema Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp).
I am referring to the first six pages only, that they refer to in their navigation
sidebar as "XSD Schema". I will do my best to put together a D2L quiz
based on it for the beginning of our session, to see what sticks and
where I need to put emphasis.

Update: mystery of the missing seminar solved ... I didn't
push it to my repo :( It will be next week's prep:)
