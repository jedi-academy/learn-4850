## Week 3 - Jan 21 

No specific prep needed for this week's seminar - we are going to continue
working with the DOM API, but from the "other side", i.e. building
or modifying a DOM object.

I have updated seminar 3, based on what we discovered during class.
It should be a bit easier to follow now!

### Lab 1 Marked

I have finished marking lab 1, and posted the feedback.

Many of my observations are just that, observations, and they don't
necessarily mean that you should change your XML data.
Please review them with me if you have questions, before changing anything!

### Week 2 - Jan 14

We will be working with XML in class this week.
Our seminar will walk you through building a simple Node app
to read and process your sushi menu data, in order to provide
a menu ... well, a sort of menu :)

I recommend that you read the W3C's official explanation
of the [Document Object Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/introduction.html),
as that is the starting point for all things XML.
Don't worry about the linked "Conformance" documents.

Message me on slack, or email me, with any questions about the DOM,
and I will make sure to incorporate them into this week's session.

### Sushi Menus

As promised, I am making the sushi menus available for download.
I have added a line item for them in thr organizer, week 1.
