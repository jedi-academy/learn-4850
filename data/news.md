## Week 10 - Mar 18

This week, we start our third & final topic grouping: eXtensible
Stylesheet Language (XSL) :)

I have posted the presentation I plan to use. The actual seminar and lab will
be posted later this evening.

## Assignment 2 Update

I understand that a number of you are struggling with assignment 2,
given the current program workload. Several have asked about having
assignment 2 due after spring break. 
There was some concern about not having assignment 1 grades, but the
feedback I gave each group in class this week should be what you need
to move forward. I will try to get the grades published as soon as
practical.

I am willing to accommodate you somewhat, by extending the 
assignment 2 due date
to the weekend after spring break, namely Mar 17th. I see this as giving you two
more days to work on the assignment, not seven - I want you to have a proper
break! To encourage that, I will award a 10% bonus to submissions on or before the
original due date, i.e. by 11:30 pm this Sunday.

I am happy to set up zoom sessions, as needed, this Sunday (Mar 10th) or
next Sunday (Mar 17th), between noon & 4pm.

We will be starting on XSL transformations after spring break, 
using the sushi menus XML data. The XSL that we create will not rely
on your XSDs.

## Week 9 - Mar 4

Two things to share with you this week: XML keys and XML annotations.
The first is a heads up at this point, and something you *could*
integrate into assignment 2. The second is how you should be commenting
the elements and attributes of your schema, and it will be added to the
rubric for assignment 2, when I create the dropbox.

No specific reading for this week - just make sure you have the first cut
of your schemas for me to take a look at. Once we have talked about keys
and annotations, and done a small exercise with them, you will have time
to work on your assignment.

I have made a few corrections to the post spring break sessions, with an
extra week on XSL but dropping XML-FO and XML databases. We will talk
about the XML pipeline during the review session in week 13.

### Lab 5

I have finished grading lab 5, and posted the marks. They were not very good.
I hope that the time we spent alst week, and working on assignment 2 this week,
will help improve your understanding and construction of XSDs!
