## Week 6 - Feb 11

Please work through Seminar05 from last week (the one I forgot to push to the
repo). It will be the starting point for this week's deeper dive
into schemas!


## Week 5 - Feb 4

We start our exploration of XML schemas this week, and I just know you
have been looking forward to this, after DTDs!

We will take a light look at schema basics, including simple and complex
elements, but leave the heavier stuff until next week. This will let
us put time aside in class for you to work on your assignment, and
get help with it.

As preparation for class this week, please read the 
[W3Schools XML Schema Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp).
I am referring to the first six pages only, that they refer to in their navigation
sidebar as "XSD Schema". I will do my best to put together a D2L quiz
based on it for the beginning of our session, to see what sticks and
where I need to put emphasis.

**Update: mystery of the missing seminar solved ... I didn't
push it to my repo :( It will be next week's prep:)**

## Week 4 - Jan 28

We will be constraining XML with document type definitions (DTDs)
this week. I have a powerpoint presentation for you to read
over the weekend (see the week 4 tab). It is dry, but a reference for DTDs, and we
will refer to it during our seminar this week.

Update for lab 4 posted! See below!
