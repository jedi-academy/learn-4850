## Course specific requirements

The expected workload for this course is one hour out-of-class for each timetabled hour.

Weekly readings will be assigned, starting with the second week, following a flipped learning model.

Some labs are individual, while others will use pair programming. Lab grading 
will be by rubric, and the two members of a pair do not have to receive the same grade. 
Lab work is meant to be completed during the lab period, with time available to 
apply the lab's outomes to the students' assignments.

Assignments will be completed in student-selected project teams of 2-3 members. 
The same team will be used for all assignments. If a student does not have a team, 
they will be assigned one by the instructor. Team members' grades are commensurate 
with their contribution, as well as performance assessed by an assignment rubric.

Course materials (lessons, examples, tutorials, labs and assignments) will be 
shared through a public website (the course “hub”), with sensitive material on D2L. 
Lab and assignment feedback will be provided through the D2L dropboxes. 
The D2L gradebook will be useful only to review D2L-captured grade components, 
and it will not provide an accurate final grade in the course.

Students who miss class for an acceptable reason will be excused from attendance 
and survey/quiz/questionnaire completion, should those fall during the excused period. 
Missed readings or lab work will need to be made up by the student.


## Course schedule

This course does not have a midterm. Students may request an individual or team interview with the instructor.  
Refer to the organizer on the course hub home page for more detailed schedule information.
