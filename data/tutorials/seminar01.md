# Seminar01 - Build an XML document
ACIT4850 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Tutorial Goals

This tutorial will walk you through creating an XML document.

Our excuse will be creating a "spec" for a vehicle we wish to buy.
It can be pretty much anything, so long as the manufacturer
has a "build and price" option for the vehicle you are interested in.

There are several smaller steps to the tutorial. 
Nothing has to be handed in for this - that is coming up.

## Planning

Choose a make & model to build.

Choose 3 or more categories of options.

Choose perspective: building a menu for a prospective buyer, or spec'ing
a vehicle you want to buy. First: all options, second: only those options you want.

## The End Result

We will end up with an XML document that is well-formed,
and which describes the configuration of a vehicle we are interested
in. You should be able to print this out and take it to a dealer
to negotiate pricing :-/

You are welcome to use the same make & model that I do, in which
case your document will be similar to mine, though not necessarily the same.

## 1. Start the document

- signature
- root element

## 2. Meta information

- make
- model
- nearest dealer?
- unique identifier?

## 3. Basic model information

- basic model information

## 4. Options (repeat per category)

- add options, 1 at a time
- for each, any choices ... size, color, ...
