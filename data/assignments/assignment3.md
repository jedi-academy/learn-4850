# Assignment 3 - Generate timetables using XSL
ACIT4850 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Assignment Goals

This assignment applies the techniques from seminars 10 through 12,
adding an XSL stylesheet to your XML documents, to produce student and
instructor timetables.

## Submission

Use the same groups as for assignments 1 & 2.

A marking rubric will be attached to the dropbox.

Submit a compressed copy of your project folder (zip or tarball) to the appropriate D2L dropbox.

Due: Sunday, Apr 14, 17:30 PST (Note earlier time than previous assignments)

## And ... Here We Go

For both students and instructors, create XSL stylesheets to produce
timetables in the sample format provided by the files in D2L content.

When your app creates the XML documents, it should include
the directive binding them to the appropriate stylesheet.
